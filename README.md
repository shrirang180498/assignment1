  ## Rectangle Prism Colume Calculation ##
	


## Objective::  ##
This approach gives a bash script to calculate the volume of a triangle prism with the formula: Volume = Height x Width x Length.
Followed by validating the values ans testing the scripts.


## Files Included:
rect_prism_main.sh    : The main file
rect_vol_prism_test.sh: The main test file
vol_alfanum_test.sh   : Ananother file where the tets case fails 
	


# Order to run the files: ##
1. Run the Main file 
2. Run the Main test file: bash rect_vol_prism_test.sh - It will get the user to input the values and calculate
the rectangle and will tell if the tets is passed
3. Run an another test fie: back vol_alfanum_test.sh  - It will validate the alfanumeric value and if entered it will give an
error n notifies that the test case is failed



## Additional Tests to Consider
- Enter the mathematical constant values to find volume
